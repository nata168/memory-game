# Memory Game

A simple memory game built using the React library and Vite. The game works as follows: the player is shown six different cards each round. Each time the player selects a card that has not been chosen during the current round, they earn one point, and the cards are shuffled. To win the game with a perfect score, the player must choose every card without repetition. Selecting a card that has already been chosen results in an immediate loss, and the game resets.
